            <p>The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.</p>

        <article id="second" class="purple">
            <h2>Id Selector</h2>
            <p>The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
                The id of an element is <span class="highlight">unique</span> within a page, so the id selector is used
                to select one unique element!
                A class cannot start with a number.
            </p>
        </article>
        <article id="third" class="purple highlight">
            <!--NOTE:- Here,we have given two class which are purple and highlight.-->
            <h2>Class Selector</h2>
            <p>The class Selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute. To select elements with a
                specific class, write a period(.) character, followed by the class name.
                An id cannot start with a number.
            </p>
        </article>

        <section id="fourth">
            <article id="nest">
                <p>Hello, How are u ??</p>
                <p>Priority Order:- id > class > element</p>
                <p>B'coz:- Let's say, we have apply css property on p i.e. these property will apply to all the
                    paragraphs. <br>
                    if we have given class purple i.e. those element who has purple class will follow these property
                    <br>
                    if we have given id then these property will apply to only that element which has these id. <br>
                    id is more specific then class and class is more specific then element. <br>
                    E.g:- As, we have given font color red to the 2nd article by using id and purple color by using
                    class. But as u can see that color of 2nd article is red NOT purple, this is b'coz of priority
                    order. <br>
                    That means, cascading/ordering doesn't matter if we have given high specificition. <br>
                    If two or more than two selectors are of same specifiction/priority then cascading/ordering matters.
                    E.g:- 5<sup>th</sup>article. <br>
                    id's used in js to select an element. we are making links with the help of id's But How ? <br>
                </p>
                <hr>
                Among all of these, we also have pseudo selectors, pseudo elements.:- By the help of this We can select
                different-different states of any element. <br>
                E.g:-
                <code class="highlight"> <!--How to use code tag ?????????-->
                          p:hover{
                                font-family:monospace;
                          }
                </code>

                <ul id="list" class="mycolor">
                    <li>We should have to use id as minimum as possible.instead of that We should use classes in CSS
                    </li>
                    <li>Priority Order:- id>class>element &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hint:-(ICE) </li>
                    <li>If same priority then oredr matters.</li>
                    <li>Universal Selector(*) has more priority. Apply to all the elements.</li>
                    <li>Gouping Selectors:- e.g:- #first, #second</li>
                    <li>Nested Selector:- e.g:- #first>p </li>
                    <li>pseudo Selector, pseudo-element</li>
                    <li>!important  ==> Don't use it unless u absolutely have to. It's priority is very high. <br>
                        Don't use very much. Don't misuse it. <br>
                       E.g:- We will use when we want to use same property of button in our website.
                    </li>
                </ul>

    <!--id is used in css,js to get/target the element. But, it is not recommended to do css with id. you should use class instead of that.-->
    <!-- Benefits of class:- we can give same class to different-different element -->
