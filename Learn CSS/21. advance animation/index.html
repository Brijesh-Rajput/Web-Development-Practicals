        <p>As we know transition works when we perform some action like hover action. <br>
            Css allows animation of html elements without using js.
            u can chanage as many CSS properties as u want,as often as u wish.
            To use CSS animation,u must first specify some keyframes for the animation. <br>
            Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.
            <br>
            Properties are:- animation-name, animation-duration, animation-delay, animation-iteration-count,
            amimation-direction, animation-timing-function, animation-fill-mode.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h3>animation-direction:-</h3>
        It specifies whether an animation should be played forwards,backwards, or in alternate cycles. bydefault value
        is normal.
        <br>
        normal :- animation played as normals(forwards) <br>
        reverse :- animation played in reverse direction(backwards) <br>
        alternate :- animation is played forwards first, then backwards <br>
        alternate-reverse :- animation is played backwards first, then forwards. <br>
        <br>
        animation start kaha se karni hai aur end kaha par karni hai. <br>
        Normal :- animation starts from 0% and goes to 100% <br>
        Reverse:- animation starts from 100% and goes to 0% <br>
        </p>
        <p> <h3>animation-fill-mode:-</h3>
            It specifies style for target element when animation not playing.(before it starts,after it ends,or both).
            <br>
            none:- (default value) Animation will not apply any styles to element before or after it's executing. <br>
            forwards:- element will retain style values that is <mark> set by the last keyframe</mark>(depends on animation-direction and animation-iteration-count) <mark>How it depends on the animation-iteration-count ?? Answer:- let animation-direction:alternate; and forwards value for animation round odd and even is different.</mark> <br>
            backwards:- element will get style values that is <mark> set by the first keyframe </mark>(depends on animation-direction) , and retain this during the animation-delay period. <br>
            both:- animation will follow rules for both forwards and backwards,
